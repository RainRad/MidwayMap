2nd Repo 
Work in Progress: 

This project is intended to utilize the Google Maps API in order to locate the mid-way point between two locations, and suggest suitable meet-up points between those spots. 

For example, John lives in Pittsburgh, and Sammy lives in Philadelphia. What resturants could  they meet at midway between their two homes such that they both drive a fair (equal) distance?
